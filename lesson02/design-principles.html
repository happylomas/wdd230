                    Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance.
                    In this type of design, you make sure you want to place the element in order of importance. 
                    looking at the image of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints above,
                    you will see that the image there discrib everything about the site.
                    Jesus Christ with open hands showing a sign of welcome and a lot of people are gathering.
                    below it's a simple phrase "come unto Jesus" it is on bold and easy to identify after the image.
                    with just this two element anyone can know that this is a relgious site.

                <h1>PARC: Repetition</h1>
                <h2>Amazon</h2>
                <h3>amazon.com</h3>
                <img src="images/amazon.jpeg" alt="Amazon Image">
                <p>
                    Repetition helps to create a sense of unity and to reinforce the overall message.
                    That way, item are placed in a logical and cohesive manner that helps the user to know the concept of the element.
                    Looking at the screenshot from Amazon page you will that the size of all the items are the same, the front are also the same
                    This make the user to know where to fix their eyes or visual, if they want to look very well at the item they want to buy or if they 
                    want to know the name of the product.
                </p>

                <h1>White Space and Clean Design</h1>
                <h2>Jumia</h2>
                <h3>jumia.com</h3>
                <img src="images/jumia.jpeg" alt="Jumia Image">
                <p>
                    Applying white space ensures the correct proportion and equal distribution of design elements and empty spaces.
                    The white space helps the desinger to create more elements or items 
                    Adding white space in the right places enables you to guide the viewerâ€™s eyes and direct them to the most important parts of your design.
                    Applying correct margins and ample paragraph and line spacing is one way of using white space to improve the presentation of text.
                    Just like in the image above it has a uniform margins.
